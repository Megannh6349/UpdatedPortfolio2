                    <p class="aboutMeText flow-text">Welcome to my page! My name is
                        Megan, and I’m an aspiring web developer. I currently reside in Monmouth Junction, NJ.
                        Full-time, I work on behalf of Microsoft, and part-time, I bartend at a small craft brewery
                        in
                        North Jersey. While I see many portfolios discuss what the developer’s specialties are and
                        how
                        many years of
                        experience they have, I have no specialties and zero years of experience! So I’m simply
                        going to
                        write a bunch of nonsense to waste your time.</p>
                    <p class="aboutMeText flow-text">Hmmm... yes, I can see why using some lorem ipsum would work better
                        here.
                        Trust me, I get that. But that's not what I'm going to do. I'm really good at coming up with
                        meaningless nonsense to write to fill up space, so that's not an issue at all. I'm really
                        torn
                        at this point. I could just switch to lorem ipsem, but I
                        guess that's kind of the easy way out, considering I just spoke against it. Maybe I could do
                        something else? Like the entire Bee Movie script. That's still a thing, right? Or the lyrics
                        to
                        <i>Actual Cannibal Shia Lebouf?</i></p>
                    <p class="aboutMeText flow-text" id="shiaLebouf">You're walking in the woods <br>
                        There's no one around and your phone is dead <br>
                        Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him <br>
                        (Shia LaBeouf)<br>
                        <br>
                        He's following you, about thirty feet back <br>
                        He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint <br>
                        He's... what are the words again?</p>

                        for
                        more pictures? More information about me? A lovely picture of the trip I took with my
                        parents to
                        a Sunflower farm on my Mom's birthday? Well, good news! One of those things is
                        here!<br><br>Here
                        is

        <div class="row mb-3 mt-3 ml-3">
            <p class="aboutMeText flow-text">But yeah, you won't really find any of that here. Just filler crap, more
                filler
                crap,
                and words, words, words. Better luck next time! In the mean time, if you've gotten this far, I
                SINCERELY
                apologize. I thought it would be funnier than lorem ipsum and did not intend for you to still be
                reading
                this.</p>
